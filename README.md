# Parallel-Algorithm-Final-Project

The repository contains code implementation of Parallel N-Body Simulation using CUDA. The repository has 2 directories - "cpu" which contains sequential implementation of BH and DS algorithms. This acts as a baseline for the CUDA implementation. 

The directory "gpu" contains BH and DS Cuda implementation.

To compile each code, refer to the README.md placed under each sub-directory.
